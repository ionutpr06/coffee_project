				<li><b class="titul">Arabica Coffee</p><p class="subtitul">Arabica coffee began spreading around the world in the mid-1700s. Historically, most coffees were descendant from Typica and Bourbon. In the mid-20th century, breeders began introducing "introgressed" varieties resistant to coffee leaf rust. More recently, genetically diverse F1 hybrids have been introduced</p></li>	
				<li><p class="titul">Coffee Robusta</p> <p class="subtitul"> Robusta is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known by the synonym Coffea robusta, the plant is currently scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main varieties, C. c. robusta and C. c. nganda.[1] The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a robust tree or shrub to about 10 m tall. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10–11 months for cherries to ripen, producing oval-shaped beans.
				The robusta plant has a greater crop yield than that of arabica, contains more caffeine (2.7% compared to arabica's 1.5%),[4] and contains less sugar (3–7% compared to arabica's 6–9%).[5] As it is less susceptible to pests and disease,[6] robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica.</p></li>
				<li><p class="titul">Coffee Liberica</p><p class="subtitul"> The Coffea liberica tree grows up to 9 metres in height, producing larger fruits than those found on Coffea arabica trees. It was brought to Indonesia to replace the arabica trees killed by the coffee rust disease at the end of the 19th century. It is still found in parts of Central and East Java and West Kalimantan today. A rare and one-of-a-kind cultivar of liberica can be found in a secluded area of the Amazon Rainforest of Guyana.

				Liberica is also the main coffee species cultivated in the Philippines and Malaysia. The city of Lipa in those province of Batangas became the country's biggest producer of arabica in the 1880s until that industry collapsed from coffee rust in the 1890s, killing almost all arabica plants in the area and threatening the variety with extinction. As in Indonesia, the liberica bean was brought in to replace it. Today, Batangas and the neighboring province of Cavite are producers of a varietal of liberica known as barako (Spanish: café verraco). In Malaysia it is generally grown in Malaysia's Coffee Belt on the west coast of Johor largely due to Javanese immigration to Malaysia in the 19th century.</p></li>
